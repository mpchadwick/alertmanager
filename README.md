# Alertmanager

The Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct receiver integration such as email, PagerDuty, or OpsGenie. It also takes care of silencing and inhibition of alerts.

* [Documentation](http://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/)


## Installation

### Build dependencies

These dependencies are necessary for building Alertmanager. There are no runtime dependencies, as the resulting binary is statically linked.

Debian family:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libc6-dev

Red Hat family:

    sudo yum install glibc-static

### Compiling the binary

The current version has to be run from the repository folder as UI assets and notification templates are not yet statically compiled into the binary.

You can either `go get` it:

```
$ GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1 go get github.com/prometheus/alertmanager
# cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus/alertmanager
$ alertmanager -config.file=<your_file>
```

Or checkout the source code and build manually:

```
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus
$ git clone https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager.git
$ cd alertmanager
$ make build
$ ./alertmanager -config.file=<your_file>
```

## Example

This is an example configuration that should cover most relevant aspects of the new YAML configuration format. Authoritative source for now is the [code](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/tree/dev/config).

```yaml
global:
  # The smarthost and SMTP sender used for mail notifications.
  # If the host requires authentication, set SMTP_AUTH_USERNAME and SMTP_AUTH_PASSWORD
  # environment variables.
  smtp_smarthost: 'localhost:25'
  smtp_from: 'alertmanager@example.org'

# The root route on which each incoming alert enters.
route:
  # The root route must not have any matchers as it is the entry point for
  # all alerts. It needs to have a receiver configured so alerts that do not
  # match any of the sub-routes are sent to someone.
  receiver: 'team-X-mails'
  
  # The labels by which incoming alerts are grouped together. For example,
  # multiple alerts coming in for cluster=A and alertname=LatencyHigh would
  # be batched into a single group.
  group_by: ['alertname', 'cluster']
  
  # When a new group of alerts is created by an incoming alert, wait at
  # least 'group_wait' to send the initial notification.
  # This way ensures that you get multiple alerts for the same group that start
  # firing shortly after another are batched together on the first 
  # notification.
  group_wait: 30s

  # When the first notification was sent, wait 'group_interval' to send a batch
  # of new alerts that started firing for that group.
  group_interval: 5m

  # If an alert has successfully been sent, wait 'repeat_interval' to
  # resend them.
  repeat_interval: 3h 

  # All the above attributes are inherited by all child routes and can 
  # overwritten on each.

  # The child route trees.
  routes:
  # This routes performs a regular expression match on alert labels to
  # catch alerts that are related to a list of services.
  - match_re:
      service: ^(foo1|foo2|baz)$
    receiver: team-X-mails

    # The service has a sub-route for critical alerts, any alerts
    # that do not match, i.e. severity != critical, fall-back to the
    # parent node and are sent to 'team-X-mails'
    routes:
    - match:
        severity: critical
      receiver: team-X-pager

  - match:
      service: files
    receiver: team-Y-mails

    routes:
    - match:
        severity: critical
      receiver: team-Y-pager

  # This route handles all alerts coming from a database service. If there's
  # no team to handle it, it defaults to the DB team.
  - match:
      service: database

    receiver: team-DB-pager
    # Also group alerts by affected database.
    group_by: [alertname, cluster, database]

    routes:
    - match:
        owner: team-X
      receiver: team-X-pager

    - match:
        owner: team-Y
      receiver: team-Y-pager


# Inhibition rules allow to mute a set of alerts given that another alert is
# firing.
# We use this to mute any warning-level notifications if the same alert is 
# already critical.
inhibit_rules:
- source_match:
    severity: 'critical'
  target_match:
    severity: 'warning'
  # Apply inhibition if the alertname is the same.
  equal: ['alertname']


receivers:
- name: 'team-X-mails'
  email_configs:
  - to: 'team-X+alerts@example.org'

- name: 'team-X-pager'
  email_configs:
  - to: 'team-X+alerts-critical@example.org'
  pagerduty_configs:
  - service_key: <team-X-key>

- name: 'team-Y-mails'
  email_configs:
  - to: 'team-Y+alerts@example.org'

- name: 'team-Y-pager'
  pagerduty_configs:
  - service_key: <team-Y-key>

- name: 'team-DB-pager'
  pagerduty_configs:
  - service_key: <team-DB-key>
```

## Testing

If you want to test the new Alertmanager while running the current version, you can mirror traffic to the new one with a simple nginx configuration similar to this:

```
server {
  server_name <your_current_alertmanager>;
  location / {
    proxy_pass  http://localhost:9093;
    post_action @forward;
  }
  location @forward {
    proxy_pass http://<your_new_alertmanager>:9093; 
  }
}
```
